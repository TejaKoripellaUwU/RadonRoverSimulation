Teja,

I have lots of questions about this project. Where did this idea come from?
Why simulate radiation? Why does the robot need to learn?

In general, you should start off with a clear problem statement and then find
the simplest path that will get you to a solution. I can't tell whether your
solution is more complicated than necessary, or you just haven't told me yet
what it is about the problem itself that requires all this machinery.

But you have a program that runs, looks cool, and does something! For this
first project that's a win, even if I don't understand what it's doing and
why. :-)
